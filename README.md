# Context and goal

I have done this application for login folow.

This app is made to be simple and may help people knowing React to get into creating mobile apps. It's made with React Native.

## Main technologies used

- [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native)

> A framework for building native apps with React.

- [React Native Elements](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-elements)

## Running the project

- Clone this project
```
git clone < project-url.git >
```

- [Install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your computer.

- [Install yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) on your computer
> Yarn is a dependency manager built by facebook and google. It is a more efficient and reliable (thanks to yarn.lock) alternative of npm.

- Launch ``` yarn ``` command in a terminal opened in the project folder.
> This command will look into the *package.json* file and install all the dependencies listed here.

- Install react-native-cli globally on your computer
```
yarn global add react-native-cli
```

### Android steps

- Launch a virtual android device [(through *Android Studio* for instance)](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html#viewing)

> If you have never installed any android virtual device, [follow those instructions](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html#createavd)

- Then, run the project in executing on your project folder:

```
react-native start

react-native run-android
```
